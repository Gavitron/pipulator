The fallout executable listens on:
  TCP port 27000
  UDP port 28000

----

android app broadcasts:

  UDP 28000
  {"cmd":"autodiscover"}

PC app gets broadcast,
replies directly with:

  UDP 28000
  {
    "IsBusy" : false,
    "MachineType" : "PC"
  }

android app displays list of responses
user selects a listed device

---

app connects:

  TCP 27000 : <deviceIP>

PC immediately sends a gestalt of pipboy state:
  connecting to 192.168.42.101 port 27000
  sending "'\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00'"
  received "'#\x00\x00\x00\x01'"
  received "'{"lang":"en","version":"1.1.30.0"}\n'"
  received "'\x90\x95\x05\x00\x03'"

app presumably verifies version & lang, then replies with a 5-null heartbeat:

  '\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00'

server MUST respond with same 5 nulls or app will disconnect after 5 failed sends.

--

app & server now trade '\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00' back & forth to keep the connection open.

--

Changing tabs on the pipboy app results in messages like:
 '{"type":14,"args":[],"id":6}'

 where "id" appears to represent the page being viewed.

 --

 also note,  app shows 'view mode' at top of screen, like when game is paused.  need to gather more data on how to change that.

 ---

Wire Protocol appears to be:

: Length (uint) : Command Type (byte) : Payload (LengthByte) :

Known Command Types:
  0  )  heartbeat
  1  )  json version string
  3  )  serialized game info - this can be any length, and is simply a binary stream of changed data, encoded as below.
  5  )  json-encoded events from the app
