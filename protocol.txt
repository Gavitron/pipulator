The fallout executable listens on:
	TCP port 27000
	UDP port 28000

----

android app broadcasts:

	UDP 28000
	{"cmd":"autodiscover"}

PC app gets broadcast,
replies directly with:

	UDP 28000
	{
		"IsBusy" : false,
		"MachineType" : "PC"
	}

android app displays list of responses
user selects a listed device

---

app connects:

	TCP 27000 : <deviceIP>

PC immediately sends a gestalt of pipboy state:
	<repl.txt>

app presumably verifies version & lang, then replies with a 5-null string:

	'\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00'

server MUST respond with same 5 nulls or app will disconnect after 5 failed sends.

--

app & server now trade '\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00' back & forth to keep the connection open.

--

Changing tabs on the pipboy app results in messages like:
 '{"type":14,"args":[],"id":6}'

 where "id" appears to represent the page being viewed.

 --

 also note,  app shows 'view mode' at top of screen, like when game is paused.  need to gather more data on how to change that.

 The last byte in the heartbeat seems to not matter,  have seen \x01 as well,  and changing it on the server has no effect.
